# ReddiTok
Creating a bot that automatically creates reddit videos on tiktok --> My bot is running on this account: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRJXdpT2/


1) Setup a Reddit developer account to be able to scrape using PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quick_start.html)
2) Download code and edit PATH_TO_VIDEO_STORAGE, PATH_TO_AUDIO_STORAGE, PATH_TO_SCREENSHOT_STORAGE since the video, screenshots and audios will save separately before compiling it all
3) Can change the subreddit name as well as filter in main.py (Currently set to a popular subreddit and filter="Month")
4) The videos will save in folder and you can upload to tiktok
